This website was created first while learning HTML and CSS.
Learned a lot about Html and Css how they are linked and used in combination to build beautiful webpages.

Although this webpage isn't responsive, it has been made using the float properties of CSS and is least responsive in terms of images.

As this was a beginner level project, so didn't use flex or grid. It was more than a practise to what i had learned.
